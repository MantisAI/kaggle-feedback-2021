We should disband nato because nato makes the world's less safe.
And the biggest reason why it makes the world less safe is because it essentially creates this like in group and out group dynamic in which it creates a sense of a greater competition.
So for a big reason why immediately when as soon as nato was formed the soviet union immediately formed the warsaw pact is because once you take aggressive actions to create an alliance of a certain group of nations other nations are going to feel the need to do the same thing to compete so to assuage their senses of fear.
And I think that in a lot of ways this is largely unnecessary and ridiculous and I also think that as far as actually creating real safety it's relatively ineffective in doing so.
So for example like as soon as the ukraine as soon as ukraine was considering joining nato russia immediately decides to invade part of it and take crimea I think the I think that most if not all of the baltic states are a part of nato russia obviously wasn't very happy about that and it regularly engages in like rather aggressive actions in areas like flying planes and like in like nearby air space and things like that and.
So obviously when you take aggressive actions like this you need to respond in like with aggressive actions and I think that disbanding nato would send a very strong message that we're not interested in military imperialism and the like and trying to create a sense of fear via military force.
But don't think for a second that just because you just disband nato people who countries like russia are suddenly just going to start invading everyone left and right because obviously it's not like america really needs nato to invade a country or do whatever it want with a country if it choose to do so like america invaded iraq without nato america's invaded plenty of other countries without nato it's just a thing that america does sometimes so ultimately I really think that the deterrence of fact isn't unique to nato and it only contributes to further ratcheting up of tensions and it's a symbolic pressure that pisses people off and that's not very good.
But additionally also I think that disbanding nato is going to remove part of american militarism from the world which I think is a good thing.
Because I think that it's absolutely ridiculous that america's military needs to spend more than like the next dozen or so military combined have bases all around the world in huge armies spending trillions of dollars on its military when in reality a lot of this is largely unnecessary and it's trillions of dollars that could be spent on very needed domestic improvements or I don't know maybe helping people in the international community instead of getting ready to like break down conflicts in things like that so for all those reasons we should disband nato.
