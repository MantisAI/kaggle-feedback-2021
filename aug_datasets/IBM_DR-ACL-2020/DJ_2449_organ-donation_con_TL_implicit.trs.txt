Organ donation should not be mandatory because mandatory organ donation is absolutely a rights violation, and it's a rights violation because when you think about it if there is anything that we have ownership over if there's anything that's truly ours it's our body and like the things that go on in our body.
The reason why people are one like one of the big reasons why people hate it when the government tries to regulate things like abortion or contraceptives because it's seen as like regulating women's bodies, trying like to make them do things.
One of the reasons why people hate it when those kinds of regulations are in place because they look at this like a basic infringement on their economy and their right to make choices in the way they want to do.
And I think that's important because you live in a society where value on things is objective and people make choose to live their lives in different ways so what you want to do is you want to try to respect that as much as possible and not do things that violate other people's preferences, especially when it's about something that's very personal like their literal body like the what they do with their body.
I think that if you want to correct things like the problems of laziness in organ donation, the problem with too few donors, the problem with like most people not being in it, you can do like alternatives like you can make it maybe everyone's automatically enrolled as an organ donor and it's opt out so if you have some kind of reason like maybe for like a religious reason of which there are many, there's ways you can get around that, there's ways that you can still act on that.
But it gets around essentially the problem of like laziness where people don't go out of their way to become organ donors because like maybe a lot of people don't know how to do it not everyone always gets approached about it, people may not people may do it but then forget that they have to like renew something or there's all different kinds of ways in which people people maybe like misjudging the risks or rewards or benefits of it, people may be worried about various things.
So I like you can just let make it opt out or some kind of alternate like that.
But it's important because there are valid reasons why people would want to opt out besides just like arbitrary preferences and like value of their own body because like a lot of people have deep deeply founded religious beliefs where they believe that like god created them god created people in like their perfect light something like that and that that's like the reason why you're not supposed to do things often times like like like get piercings or tattoos or commit suicide or things like that because you're altering god's creation.
So like a lot of lot of religions have a very big problem with organ donation and medical procedures like that, so like you're you're you're pretty severely infringing on their rights if you make organ donation mandatory and that's pretty bad.
The final thing is that I don't actually think that organ donation is going to be as necessary in the long term as it is right now and the big reason for that is because things like stem cell research, cloning organs from like grafts of like different parts of the body and the like are things that are probably going to happen sooner rather than later in medical fields probably in the lifetime of many of us probably something rather soon and that's that's important because if if organ donation is something that is like really really cheap and like so widely available and free because everyone's donating organs afterwards there's less of a necessity to like spend a lot of invesment and time researching better alternatives like cloning things like that.
So for all those reasons, organ donation should not be mandatory.
