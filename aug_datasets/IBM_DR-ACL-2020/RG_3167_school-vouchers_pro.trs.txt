The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce school vouchers � the way that we would model this is that every parent would be given one voucher per kid � this would be government provided and this culture would be used to send their child to any high school outside of the regional district.
Two main areas of clash.
The first on the rights of parents and children.
We think that it is generally accepted that parents have a right to manipulate.
It includes their children's environment in order to raise their children in the way that they like think they ought develop.
We think that in in parallel to this children also have a right to have access to wholesome education insofar as it defines what their future is going to be and whether or not they can actually move out of maybe their current financial bracket or be able to access better opportunities in the future.
The problem of limiting school these kind of vouchers provide a more specificity in choice and it allows parents to exercise more freedom with regards to how they want their children to develop and be raised.
The problem with limiting school districts per geography is that you're only limiting it for those who cannot afford to change their situation which means rich people have this right to manipulate their children's environment as they see fit but only those who cannot afford it cannot cannot actually like access this like better world.
If we don't like the is the district they're in richer parents can afford to send kids to private schools, hire tutors that can change their situations, but even if you don't buy that there's a right money is the most arbitrary way in which to separate who is deserving of a better education and who isn't.
People are born into arbitrary financial circumstances that are often incredibly difficult to move up from.
More than this, children are equally deserving of a good education since they especially did not choose their situation.
We think if anything, the only way in which children can move away from their upbringing and up and move upwards in terms of economic bracket is if they have an initial good education so that they can access everything in the future.
Because recognize that currently that is the defining factor if I don't get into a good college it is very unlikely that I'm going to be able to access a high paying job.
Second area of clash has to do with benefits of specific education to children.
Too many areas under this m first on how it is better educationally.
We think that when students with specific passions are able to specifically choose schools that are focused on those regions so say that I am very passionate about science or technology I can access a high school that is specific to stem then these students are more likely to be able to grow that passion, learn more about it and build a resume so that they can access a better like college and like access better opportunities in the long term.
We prefer that students are able to be passionate about what they want to be and explore those fields early on rather than waste their time with useless extracurriculars the current public schools overload students with.
We also think that it sends a message to public schools that if they want to continue functioning they have to get better.
So on net we think our side of the house actually gets better public schools in addition to students being able to choose what charter schools they prefer to attend.
We also think there's a social portion to this kind of system.
We think that a very good example of this would be the harvey milk schools that have been established for LGBTQ youth that which provide a safer learning environment by focusing on LGBTQ history and allowing LGBTQ youths to express themselves where otherwise they would not be able to do so.
A key part of education is allowing students to feel safe in their environment because if you do not feel safe, you are unlikely to be able to learn to your full capacity.
Our side of the house creates a world in which if you don't feel comfortable going to school because you are muslim there's a lot of islamophobia, if you are gay and you do not feel comfortable because there's a lot of homophobia, you can choose an environment that will be accepting of you and let you reach your full potential.
For these reasons, proud to propose.
