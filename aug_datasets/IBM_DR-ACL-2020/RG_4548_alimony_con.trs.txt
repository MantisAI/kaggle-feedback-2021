We shouldn't abandon alimony.
I think throughout this round you have to remember that alimony isn't one size fits all.
When we have alimony it's customized to the situation and sometimes alimony doesn't even get awarded at all but abandoning alimony fully means that government has to show you why even in the most extreme situations we shouldn't have alimony because it precludes the chance that even when it is truly needed it can ever be assigned.
So they have to show you either that those extreme situations don't exist or that those extreme situations get outweighed by some harm of alimony in all the other situations which we just don't think is possible given that it isn't true.
Two main arguments: first, on justice.
Alimony isn't just awarded willy-nilly for no reason.
It's allocated based on how judges perceive the power dynamic and relationship of those two people who are getting divorced to be and this is actually very important because marriages are usually not perfect fifty-fifty splits in terms of effort or money or any number of other metrics that often get evaluated when we're considering alimony payments and this is either because someone gave up a job to take care of a family or because someone gave up their career so the other person could advance theirs in a different location or simply because people don't expect relationships to end so they build expectations of the rest of their lives around that person existing in their own and that changes the calculuses that you make and the decisions that you make in the long term which generally affects then how profitable or how happy or how like well you're doing when you're going through that to divorce at the end and when this occurs the person who took the shorter end of the stick deserves to be compensated for the years of their life that they've given to the other because that time didn't get to be spent on themselves or advancing their careers and oftentimes because that other person was being completely not loyal at that time or was hurting them emotionally in other ways and abolishing alimony would be doing these people who suffered more in that relationship an injustice by not compensating them as they are due which we actually think just outweighs any situation in which someone might be taken advantage of in alimony because alimony never hits the point where the other person can't feed themselves or is actually suffering.
It just hits this point at which we we see that maybe that person is having a less comfortable life than they alternatively would but we don't think that that's enough of a reason just abolish it entirely given that this benefit it can cause to a person who's been harmed in that relationship is so much greater than the harm it can cause to the other party.
Government probably talked about how people shouldn't be robbed of their money by their spouses but they forget the years of their life that the spouse was robbed of in the first place or the effort that that spouse put into say raising a family while the other person goes out and does work and advances their career and we think at the point that this is the way these systems work we don't really understand why we should be like why we would ever be upset about someone losing money to them if they deserved it.
Our second argument is that it is good for the family.
In situations where the spouse makes significantly less or there are children, alimony helps people get back on their feet so that they can continue on with their lives without having to rely on the government or social services and this is why it's usually conditional.
Like alimony is provided until the person gets married or the kids are a certain age and in these cases alimony can be central to people being able to get back on their feet after divorce given this is often a time of economic and personal turmoil so providing them with these measures by which they can use to prop themselves up, go back to the workforce, not worry about feeding themselves in the meantime is really beneficial.
Proud to oppose.
