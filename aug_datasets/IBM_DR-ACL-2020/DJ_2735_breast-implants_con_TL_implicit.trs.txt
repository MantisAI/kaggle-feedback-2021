We should not ban breast implants because people should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies, for the most part, particularly in this case and there's a lot of legitimate reasons why people may want to get breast implants whether it's just because they want to change the way they look so they feel better or maybe their industry requires it.
So let's start by talking about bodily autonomy because I think that that's what is at the heart of this debate.
And this is incredibly important because in general you should be able to do what you want with your body because if there's anything that we should have ownership over if there is anything that we should have control over it's being able to make decisions about what we do with our bodies and how we should look because in a lot of ways it's the most important way that we have forms of expression.
So in the same way that you have a freedom of speech you're allowed to say you don't like the government for whatever reason you want you're able to express yourself in that way.
Oftentimes your body is a form of expression too sometimes it can be political expression if you get say a tattoo that says like fuck the draft or something like that because you wanted to protest maybe a military draft or or like a peace symbol to protest like going against war or something like that like there's all kinds of ways in which obviously you can use your body for an explicitly political message but that's obviously not the limit to which expression should be protected because cultural expression expression of our interests are all ways in which we express aspects of our being and aspects of our personality to other people in society and in a lot of ways as the basis of which we engage with other people in society and it's also really important to us because what's identifies us as individual peoples as opposed to just being like a faceless mass of bodies the choices we make how we look how we dress all these things are part of our being and how we express ourselves.
So given all of that, I think that there should be a deep degree of skepticism when we just outright ban something that about regulations on what people can do with their body.
So I think that this should be limited to cases where like there's like a really really clear harm that this could have on like other people and I definitely don't think that breast implants do that.
They don't really hurt anybody they just kind of change the way that you look it's just cosmetic surgery it may not it may not be necessary for the most part you don't really need a breast breast implants if you're going to get them but it's definitely not something that really hurts anybody and it only affects you in any way so we definitely think that people you should defer to the individual choices that people make.
But, beyond that I also think there's incredibly legitimate reasons that people may have to get breast implants.
So like if you have breast breast cancer and you get a mastectomy then you may not have breasts anymore and that could be something that you feel really uncomfortable about and you don't want maybe a disease that you have to dictate the way that you look in like the same way that if somebody gets cancer and undergoes chemo and they go bald we're not going to ban people from like getting wigs so they can look like they have hair if that makes people more comfortable after they've gone through like a really a really difficult time in their lives.
In a lot of ways that could be something that like breast cancer survivors may be comfortable with,not everyone's going to want to do that but it's certainly reasonable if some people want to do that.
But additionally there's also obviously industries where getting a breast implant can maybe be helpful for you financially there's no reason why people shouldn't be able to make money off their bodies and make money off the way they look if tha's want to do so we don't bat an eye when people make money off their brains or when people make money off their bodies in terms of sports people should be able to do it based off their attractiveness too so if you work in porn if you're a model or in some other kind of industry maybe acting it may just make sense for you to get a breast implant it could be good for your business it could make you more comfortable and confident.
So for all those reasons don't ban breast implants.
