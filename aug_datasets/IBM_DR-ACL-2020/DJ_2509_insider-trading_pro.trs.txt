We should legalize insider trading because maybe I'm just cynical but insider trading is something that happens almost all the time in the status quo it's rarely prosecuted and if you legalize it at least having to pay for information while still not perfect because it's not open and accessible perfectly having to pay for information still makes it more equitable and accessible than it simply being things that exist in like backroom deals or the few people who happen to have seats on boards of multiple companies or things like that.
So what do I think happens in reality most of the time?
I think that like the people who are most likely going to like benefit the most from the legalization of insider tradings are like more common everyday investors, people who can now pay for some kind of subscription service maybe to inside information from industry sources things like that or like a more average investor.
People who were in like the one percent or are like elites in finance in the status quo oftentimes already have access to these kinds of things either illegaly because they don't care and there's no real way to it's very difficult to enforce like unless there's some kind of record of communications so things like emails or tax which a lot of people don't do because they're not stupid and they know that that it's illegal these can be conversations that people have in person and because the stock market is ultimately like a game of luck in a lot of ways there's no real way of checking against somebody doing something malicious versus doing something lucky especially if they cover their trails properly.
So the people who are like the most well connected to people who have the most money and resources and connections to people are probably already able to take advantage of these things and that's why rich people are able to do that magical thing where they can take their money and make more money so easily with it but I think that more directly as far as this impacts like the biggest corporations, the biggest investors and hedge funds and people like that I think that this is actually something that like the ban on insider trading doesn't affect them because when you think about the like biggest banks, the biggest hedge funds, the biggest capital or like companies or the biggest holding companies, a lot of them already had insider sources of multiple stations so like you can like the same like a lot of like same investors who invest in say walgreens invest in CVS the same investors who invest in sony also invest in toshiba or things like that the same people who invest in google also invest in other kinds of things like a lot of a lot of these things are interwoven and interconnected and that's why people sit on the boards of multiple corporations and things like that.
So a lot of people like by nature of like their situations already have access to a whole lot of outside information already do a lot of these kinds of things so you're not really changing all that much for them.
What you are changing is you're changing the way the average person is able to actually access trading resources which is something that I think is pretty important and I think that in a way it makes things more equitable and fair.
So for those reasons legalize insider trading.
