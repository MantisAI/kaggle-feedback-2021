We're proud to stand in opposition of the motion that international adoption should be banned.
Our first independent point is that international adoption provides a gateway for moving people from places of extreme suffering to comparatively stabler and safer environments.
So I think a lot of what gov told you about was just sort of like straw manning specific countries places like for example adopting like chinese babies or indian babies, places where there is a certain degree of like fetishization of our individual racial groups.
While this is certainly problematic from an intent perspective we think that a lot of the time international adoption actually constitutes moving children from places where they experience extreme suffering particularly there are loss of examples of adopting children from ongoing war zones for example like adoption of like syrian children is quite high right now an and often this doesn't even involve the sort of things that like gov is talking about where they're like torn away from their families because the suffering is so extreme like a lot of these children are like legitimately orphans and even if they're not, a lot of the times parents will actually voluntarily allow their children to be adopted outwards on the basis that if they can't get refugee status successfully they hope that their children are a capable of just living better lives in an area that isn't an active war zone.
We think at this point that there is a particularly utilitarian benefit to this that, simply speaking, absent cultural impacts which will get to in a moment there really is an obvious justification for allowing someone to come from a place of extreme suffering to be somewhere that is comparatively safer.
It is almost objectively true that you know somewhere in like chicago is just a safer place to live than in the middle of like an active war zone in syria.
On the point then of of these like these cultural problems that gov brings up I think the issue here is really two fold.
One is that oftentimes these locations such as like rural india do still have extreme suffering that is intrinsic to them and that there is a benefit in allowing these children to you know have a better life in a place that with more privilege and with you know more wealth where they're you know less likely to experience hunger, dehydration less likely to die of preventable diseases so this these benefits certainly are clear cut but beyond that I want to get into our second independent point which is that a lot of the abuses that are discussed by government are significantly worse in a world where this market isn't legal and therefore regulateable.
Gov specifically takes issue with the fact that there is poor regulation in the status quo that may be true I don't think that that has to be just like taken as in such a defeatist attitude though I think you can regulate this industry well if you you know have the ability to do, if you really decide that you're going to do that given that their model is that they're going to get a bunch of countries to agree on this ban anyway it seems like they're doing a lot of the legwork to get to this policy I think at that point you might as well just take that effort and channel it into regulation and the reason for this is that when you have no legal market the alternative is a black market with no regulation these abuses run even more rampant because there's no background checks if firms like adoption agencies are you know not checked over in any way, shape, or form there's no way to ensure that an individual agency is actually reputable or trustworthy and what generally happens is that the market still exists because there's demand for these children as gov explains but that also that these are often wealthy families anyway who have the capital to pay off people with unsavory business practices.
We prefer then a world where it the market is legal and regulated.
Proud to oppose.
