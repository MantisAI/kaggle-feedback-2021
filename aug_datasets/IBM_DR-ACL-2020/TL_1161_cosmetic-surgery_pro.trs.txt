We should ban cosmetic surgery.
We're at the very beginning we're just going to differentiate between cosmetic surgery being surgery that's done specifically and only for the enhancement of one's appearance, and reconstructive surgery which is a type of cosmetic surgery to repair scarring or other types of things that occur after someone's been injured or harmed in some particular manner.
We think that we should ban cosmetic surgery specifically because its existence perpetuates and allows the continuation of bad norms.
What are we talking about when we mean bad norms?
We think that cosmetic surgery first perpetuates the idea that there is some sort of idealized human form that individuals should strive to achieve.
Cosmetic surgery exists to do certain things to change an individual's appearance, and these types of things fall in line of very specific types of gender norms and body norms that exist in society today.
For example, the idea of having your facelift so that you have fewer wrinkles, or other things done to your face to make oneself look younger, and to make oneself look as if they were as if they were more naturally gifted.
What does this mean and what is the problem with that?
It means that individuals who exist in the normal world where they have bodies that aren't in this idealized form, which is the vast majority of individuals, feel ostracized within their society and feel that either a, they need to do this type of thing where they spend a vast amount of money on cosmetic surgery that isn't necessary in order to appear a specific way, which we ultimately don't think is going to make individuals feel any better about themselves, because this idea of an idealized form is something that we believe is simply unachievable, that once individuals find flaws within themselves and find this nagging need to fix those small flaws that they see, individuals are going to perpetually see those flaws, and we can bet cosmetic surgery is a route by which individuals can abuse themselves by correcting flaws that are simply not flaws in the first place.
We think when you ban cosmetic surgery you remove this type of idealized form, maybe not in the imaginary of individuals immediately, but we think what you do is you make it more difficult for individuals to change their appearance and more difficult for society to perpetuate this idea, especially in the higher classes of an idealized form and what that form is particularly, and we think that this is especially problematic issues for young people and for specifically young girls who already are feeling immense pressure about how their bodies need to appear through things like beauty magazines and other sorts of societal norms that are pushed on to these individuals.
We think that these people are specifically prone and specifically likely to be pushed into doing these types of things and taking drastic moves to change their appearance, which we think is something that is not acceptable within our society.
We think that when people at a young age are made make themselves feel as if they are lesser because of how they appear it leads to a whole sort of issues such as body dysmorphia and other eating disorders that occur when individuals think that their body is not the ideal form it leads to self harm and to depression when individuals can't feel like they're safe, or that their okay in their own skin, and we can bet cosmetic surgery, and the cult around cosmetic surgery, the social norms that surround cosmetic surgery, this idealized form that comes with it, we think that that type of problem is ultimately what leads to these things in our society and leads to a greater impact of the social norms that we have in the status quo.
Finally, we think that the idea that you can simply change the way you appear leads to types of body shaming against people, firstly against overweight people who are seen as those that are too lazy to change how they feel or don't care about how they feel or don't care about how they look, and we think that this type of body shaming is increased when you have things such as cosmetic surgery to change things, to tuck your tummy, to change how fat you look, all of those types of things.
We think that body shaming and these types of norms are particularly perpetuated through cosmetic surgery because it gives an avenue or a purported avenue to change the way you feel, and puts the onus on individuals to change the way they appear or to fall in line with those norms, rather than the onus on society to accept that these norms don't exist, and for these reasons, we think that you should ban cosmetic surgery.
