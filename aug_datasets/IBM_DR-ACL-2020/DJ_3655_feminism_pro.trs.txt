We should abandon feminism because feminism has such a bad reputation amongst men and many women that if you abandon feminism and just like push for maybe like equality in general or things like that it would be better so that's the first thing and then like secondarily feminism is oftentimes exclusive of a lot of people so feminism is oftentimes exclusive of like trans people feminism has historically been run by white people at the expense of like say black women or other minority women etcetra etcetra.
So that's why we should abandon feminism.
So let's start by talking about why feminism just isn't isn't actually that effective and it's not that effective because it has like a really bad reputation I guess if you talk to like tons of men they'll tell you that feminism has like a really bad reputation but furthermore if you talk to like a lot of women so say like maybe any like most like women that voted for trump or like most republican women are things like that like there's there's clearly an image problem there and I think it comes from the fact that feminists are oftentimes seen is inherently radical.
Feminists have been successfully scapegoated as essentially like hating men and wanting to like take things away from men that for some reason men think that they like justly acquire something like that so a lot of people really really don't like feminists.
So the result of this is that when women push for something like say abortion rights or getting rid of a wage gap or things like that the result is that these things galvanize like hordes of support amongst like in terms of opposition so by like feminist capped by feminists like identifying issues is ones that are like important for women's progress they galvanize an opposition to them that makes it less likely to happen because they're because the group that is presenting it itself is seen as an unpopular one so therefore the policies that they're trying to back are also going to be seen as unpopular so that's not good.
The next thing is that feminism has historically been exclusive and to a large extent it certainly it still is so that's another reason why you can abandon it.
So for example like you look at historically you look at feminism historically it's often done things that have tried to like primarily push like wealthier upper class white women to points so it's focused on say things like voting rights but not maybe focusing it on things like things that make it easier for women to vote so like a lot of women can't vote because they have to like work multiple jobs because they have to take care of families because of things like that or there's also a lot of other like things like wage gaps are oftentimes more pronounced for women of color than they are for white women things like that and I guess the feminist movement historically hasn't done as much as it could for those groups so that's definitely something that's not great.
You look at like a lot of you look like a lot of like like a lot of older feminists who would like push for people like hillary clinton over bernie sanders and they would like say things like gloria steinem who would say things like there is a special place in hell for women who don't support other women and by doing so they try to like silence women who have like dissenting viewpoints oftentimes like there's a whole lot of problems in feminism so yeah definitely should just abandon it so for all those reasons abandon feminism.
