We should fight for tibetan independence.
First, I want to be clear about what we mean by like, because I don't necessarily think that conceptualized violent resistance, or an attempt to violently overthrow chinese autonomy in the region.
I think that we should fight for tibetan independence via non violent means, things like economic boycotts, divestments and sanctions, supporting these things on a global scale as well, and I also think that, you should engage in maybe acts of political and civil disobedience, but the focus should always be on it being non violent in nature, and I think that this is very important on a strategic level, as far as actually getting support and sympathy in the international community, and therefore increasing your chance to actually ratchet up enough pressure on china, that they're willing to make concessions.
So, first I want to start by talking about, why I think that it's so blatantly obvious that the tibetan people deserve their independence, and that the fact that they're not currently achieving it is a travesty.
So, first, I think that they just have an affirmative right to make their own choices.
Keep in mind that, they have a distinct language, they have a distinct religion, they have a distinct culture, they're far away geographically from like beijing, they're like they're not even really all that close, they have distinct economy, they're distinct in like a ton of ways, way more distinct than anywhere else in a lot of other countries would be.
So, this is all important because, all of the political decisions that get made in your day to day life, in order for them to be, I think, legitimate, you have to be able to have some degree of say over them, and it's very clear that the tibetan people right now don't have this, and that's a right that's being deprived of them.
But I think that, secondarily, there's also almost like a negative conception, where like even if the tibetan people didn't, in theory, deserve independence, the fact that china is is oppressing, committing human rights violations, against people in tibet, is, I think, in a like a negative right sense, like they have lost their right to sovereignty over them, they have lost their right to govern over them, because they've abused that right, and they've abused the tibetan people, and therefore the tibetan people need to, in order to protect themselves, be responsible for their own governance.
But I think on the flip side, I think that when you fight for independence, you're still going to achieve a lot of good for the average tibetan person's life, and the reason for it is this, I don't necessarily think that, certainly not right away, you're actually going to be able to get independence, if you start fighting more so for independence, much more aggressively, but I do think that this is important strategically, for increasing the rights and autonomy of the average person, and here is why: while china may not be willing to give up entire independence, if enough economic pressure is growing, if enough political pressure is growing on china, because china is not some independent actor that can isolate itself from from political impacts of the world, because it's dependent on the united states purchasing and things like that, they ultimately have to listen, if there's enough pressure.
So I think that, china would be very willing to make concessions, to not make as many human rights violations, to give more autonomy, if not outright independence, and I think that this would start to be seen as a reasonable middle ground, between the status quo and independence.
While the alternative reality would be, if you're not fighting for independence, out of fear that that could lead to more crackdowns, or fear that that could make the situation worse, then ultimately you're just not going to see a change to the status quo.
So I think for all of those reasons, it's very important to fight for tibetan independence.
