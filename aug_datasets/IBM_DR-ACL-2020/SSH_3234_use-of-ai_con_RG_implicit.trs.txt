I stand and firm opposition to the motion the use of a I should be abandoned a eisen essential tool in our society and is largely the subject of a massive amounts of scrutiny despite incredibly few harms we've seen this fear of a I happening since the sixties since the very first implementations of digital computers we've seen that science fiction writers have been able to rile up the public make them afraid of a human level a I however this is simply not the case even though google has been able to beat human that chests and go we think that these are small games with set rules which are incredibly easy for a I our computers to solve there's no way in which human beings will be able to create human level a I am for the next one hundred even two hundred years yet my opponent suggests we should archive and cancel all current a I research and three arguing tries to the bad idea first it collapses society I don't think my opponent understands how often we use a I are spam filters artificial intelligence that uses different amounts of data to determine what is or is not a piece of spam and send the spam to arm your spam for this basic level technology demonstrates just how often that we use a I google maps arm phone calls finding the best wifi network each of these use a I and continually edit themselves in a way which allows better usage by human beings so by stopping the use of ali I we would destroy a huge industry which is ultimately making massive strides but we would also destroy massive amounts of technology which is currently improving our lives in a massive way while additionally simply preventing individualism self actualized by taking away their options and requiring them to use primitive technology despite the advancement that human that have made in recent years my second argument is that a I is a red herring so I said before we're not going to be able to build a human level a eye for an incredibly long time we are unable right now to define the rules of being human we can barely pay build a robot who passes the turing test was able to convince someone that they are more human than another competitor we would massively require eighty huge expansion of technology and essentially another revolution on par with micro transistors would be required to build a I in the first place we think that this also reduces funding for current AI research things like self driving cars self editing programs honestly my a I classes would be canceled because my professor would no longer be able to teach them this creates luddites within our society who hate technology in will ultimately act violently towards any sort of progress of technology which make people's lives better my third and final argument is a sleep spell over regulation whole languages are based on a I and self editing a previous code scheme unless we're using better circular evaluate irish continuously runs through the code and alters it as necessary under my opponents definition of a I this would be banned we think that the sort of regulation is the kind of thing that ultimately destroys america's place as a effective leader in technology and pushes us behind in every capacity we would both have privileged spoiled individuals who are unwilling to work low wage manufacturing jobs but also have no tech sector or service sector because it depends on our wealth and ultimately destroy our society as a whole for this reason we should not ban the use of a I the use of a I should not be abandoned
