I stand in firm opposition to the motion we should abolish capital punishment all that capital punishment is not usually the best tool for dealing with certain individuals it is essential to have it as a tool in the toolbox even if it is never used the threat of capital punishment alone concur go to great lengths in preventing further harms against civilians to that end I have three arguments first that capital punishment is a tool in the toolbox recognize that prosecutors judges juries all have discretion in deciding whether or not to give someone capital punishment we think that individuals particularly those they strong sense of justice are far less likely to use capital punishment an unjust ways what we mean by this we think that prosecutors who went into law in the first place to pursue justice and decide to work for the state rather than going to work for a cushy and what well paying private job usually have a strong sense of justice they want to fight for what is right in our society and what is best as such they're unlikely to pursue charges that will ultimately lead to the death penalty judges are individuals who are usually unable to be disbarred at this point unless they actively fight against the good of the people and ultimately do something illegal to that end because of the sort of job security and because of the position they hold with our society we think that judges are unlikely to pursue capital punishment either unless someone is a truly reprehensible individual finally we think that juries usually have a decent of information they not only have the information that comes from living in our society understanding of justice statistics and understanding our laws but are also able to sit through a multiple day trial in which to train legal professionals educate them about what they ought to do and how our system works ultimately we have a number of checks and balances to guarantee that innocent people do not get the death penalty that only that at the death penalty becomes more unpopular we think that the death penalty is not a political benefit either as such by continuing to have as a tool in the toolbox we can punish the truly awful people the jeffrey dahmer's thought ted bundy's the serial killers who have no remorse and ultimately torture the people who they attempt to harm my second argument that this deters crime it's very difficult to understand how bad prison is until you go there for many individuals this makes it said they are unlikely to use present laws and premise present punishments as a strong deterrent against criminal action we think that every individual understands death at least to an extent which allows them to know they don't want to die individuals are unlikely to pursue crime than given that adam they don't want to decide they don't want to face the punishments of their actions and so they are unlikely to take the most heinous action against our society by deterring crime that we're doing the best possible good for innocent individuals my third and final argument is that justice is idiosyncratic our government has put capital punishment in the place anti capital punishment politicians have not taken over government have not won many positions and as such it is clear that the people want capital punishment it's impossible to derive any system of judges just punishment law from any group besides the people we can't give it to any individual god because discriminatory we can't give it any individual culture or nature because there's simply no hierarchy from which we can derive the sort of considerations of justice however by allowing the people to speak by long their preferences to guide our systems of justice we can truly benefit the most people overall for this reason we should not abandon capital punishment
