I stand in firm opposition to the motion we should cancel pride parades pride parades are an essential tool for individuals who are not in the mainstream in terms of gender sexuality to come together in solidarity and empower one another ultimately pride parades are the decisions of the people who have faced this sort of expression and as such the rights should not be abridged to that and I have three arguments but first some brief about all my opponent spends most of their speech focusing on the fact that pride parades are a target for hateful groups they say that if we allow this target to exist then violence will occur because people will act out against them so to responses first there are hundreds of targets around the world around it honestly even just the state of massachusetts which are worse than pride parades pride parades are a terrible spot for a terror or heat attack because individuals can run away in numerous directions they're not in an enclosed area and they usually have police officers either attending or around them and there are hundreds of witnesses there are other targets like queer clubs like support groups like focus group that all focus on LGB teach you individuals we saw this in paris where hundreds of people were killed I'm at a club by terrorists because they want to take action against a certain group we also saw in florida at that queer individuals are targets wherever they go we think that pride parades are actually on the safer ways in which we are people can express themselves and as such my points arguments just do not stand the second we all think this is the real reason to stop a particular action white supremacists have targeted black churches since the inception of america and the introduction of christianity to black people this is not a reason to shut down every black church would fundamentally a bridge the rights of individuals to use the oppressors of violence against them to take away their rights and take away their activities please when I first argument LGB teach you individual if visibility we think that individuals are far more likely to come out if they feel like there's a community which will accept them additionally it individuals will feel more comfortable forming social groups I'm going on the public if they know that other people are also queer are also I'm a questioning individual and we think that's what the visibility empowers people it empowers people who are already out but for people who are still in the closet it tells them that they can come out live a good life and have a culture which is unique to them and which they have access to now they want to come out my second argument is LGB teach you solidarity we think that pride parades have a long history which goes back to protests against the violence against all the BTU individuals both individuals and by police officers this sort of solidarity is the best place for these protests for protest to occur it allows individuals to express their views to talk about how police continue to fail to protect LGB DQ individuals this sort of solidarity creates a stronger political and economic bloc fork where individuals which is the only way in which powerful organizations will respond to them they meaningful way my third and final argument is it leads to greater discourse by opponent argues that pride parades ultimately make people more hateful simply because people will see more deviant expressions of sexuality and have backlash against them whoever we think that individuals are far more likely to be engage in discourse in this modern day where individuals are actually more enlightened or they understand more about LGB DQ culture and the positions which they take ultimately we think that this improves individuals understanding of queer issues while also allowing people to have fun and act more effectively as a group for this reason we should not cancel pride parades whole
