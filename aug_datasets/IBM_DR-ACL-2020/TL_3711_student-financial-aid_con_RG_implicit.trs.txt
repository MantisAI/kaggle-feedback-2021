We should not increase student financial aid in the united states.
In this argument we're gonna in this round we're going to make three main arguments as to why we think that increased student financial aid would only lead to higher costs of tuition and to more people going to college that shouldn't be going there and that's where we want to start.
We don't believe that college is actually necessary nor the best path for many people.
While a college degree can be valuable if you're going into things like the sciences and to engineering and to medicine, into a profession that pays relatively well, there are also many people that go to college and seek degrees in things that are never going to be financially viable.
There are also people additionally that are able to learn the skills from college things like for example, programming skills that they would be able to learn in college but there're also an immense amount of online courses and other types of third party institutions that you can go to to get relatively high levels of education including some of these top level universities that are doing things like harvard is which is putting entire courses online and making them publicly available.
So as far as the actual educational aspect of universities, this is likely something that is not necessary for many people and we think that increasing student financial aid access through some things like a through things like a subsidy, we think this only leads to more people going into these universities when they could otherwise be going directly into the workforce, going to a trade school, doing something that would be more financially viable for them in the future and students saddle and students are still going to be saddled with debt even after more aid.
Recognize that there is that student student aid debt is one of the largest amounts of debt that exist as a as a group in the country.
Student debt is in the is in the billions and billions of dollars in the united states.
There is no feasible way that the government could cover could increase student financial aid to the level that it would actually be able to pay for all of the cost of college for all people that can't afford it and because of that, we think that even if you increase student financial aid you're probably going to be putting more people that shouldn't be going to college into college who are then going to be themselves saddled with debt that they otherwise wouldn't have had and we think that what's likely to happen if you raise student financial aid is that you would also get higher costs of tuition because colleges recognize that there is now a larger pool of funds to draw from and they can charge a a higher price and still get the same draw, the still the still the same amount of people in the door and because of that, we think that it's unlikely that you have any sort of net gain for students that fall into the category of those that should be going to college and are doing something that is going to be financially viable in the future because those costs are going to likely rise to the point that financial aid is offset by those costs because of that, we don't think that you're doing a tremendous amount of good in in in society and we think that the status quo drives students towards earning potential.
So even if you don't think it's true that costs would rise along with financial aid amounts, we think that that the status quo is creating a system where because you're likely going to be saddled with debt out of college, you go towards paths that are going to earn you more money.
You may take that major in philosophy but you also take that major in computer science as well to ensure that while you're learning philosophy you still have a financial path forward that you otherwise wouldn't have had if you didn't study that course.
For these reasons, we should not increase student financial aid in the united states.
