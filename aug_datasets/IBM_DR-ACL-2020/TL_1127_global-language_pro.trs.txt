A global language is advantageous.
The english language has become the dominant language for business, law and other sort of transnational and global interactions that occur, whether it's the fact that tourists from america can go to places like europe and southeast asia without having to speak the language that occurs there because children are taught english at young age, or whether it be the language that business is done in at the corporate level across the globe, english has become the fundamental global language or lingua franca.
This is important to recognize, it's important to recognize that the reason that english has become this way, is not because english is the easiest language to learn, which it's not, or because english is somehow more efficient for giving away or for giving information between people than other languages, because it's not.
It's important to recognize the reason that english is the global language is because english, and specifically america, and england, have been dominant power houses in the globe for the last two hundred years.
This means that essentially imperialist forces have forced english upon the rest of the world because the power houses in business, in war, and other sort of globalized important factors, are forcing this language on other countries in order for those countries to be able to interact with markets in america, and be able to interact with leaders in america, for which for many places is an important source of aid, inferred diplomatic strength, and alliances and things of that nature.
This is important because, language isn't just the way that people communicate, but it's also a sign of their culture, there're important cultural distinctions that lie within language whether it's gendered pronouns that exist in many romantic languages, or the slang that people use in the way that they speak, or the way that certain information and certain customs are given through the languages we use.
When we have a language that's a global language rather than english, which is a language that is forced on individuals, we think that more cultures are able to have an input in how that language sounds and how that language is formed, which means those languages are able to stay relevant in the current society, and are able spread themselves across the globe much as english and american culture and ideology have been able to spread itself across the globe, which we really think equalizes the playing field to some extent that imperialism over the last two hundred three hundred years has cost within our world, which we think is important, because we think that the oppression that these countries have forced on to these other nations is wrong, it's something that has violated their the nation's ability to function as it sees fit and the people's ability to rule themselves.
And we think that a good way of stepping back from that regime, stepping back from that time, is to allow the way that we communicate with each other to be something that is as global as the world that we live in.
And we live in an increasingly globalized world.
Our businesses, our global interactions at the political level, our news interactions, our cultural interactions, we're sharing the music whether it's american popular music to the east or, or k or k pop and other asian pop music to the west and a number of other ways in which we share culture in a global community.
We think that that culture and those ideas are better spread when everyone has a better understanding of the language that we're communicating in.
Through translation much can get lost.
And we think that when you don't need to continue to translate things, rather you understand the language as it is been exposed or how's, how it has been expressed, we think that you're better able to spread ideas between these communities, and you lessen differences that may exist between those communities that comes from a lack of understanding.
I think that a lot of the hate that exist within the world, a lot of the xenophobia and misunderstanding that exists between communities, is a lack of ability to communicate with those communities in a meaningful and effective way, and this would be a way of undoing that sort of that sort of thing.
We also think that, aside from the cultural benefits that you get the spread of ideas, it's also beneficial in an economic sense.
If individuals are better able to communicate with those outside of their own country or culture or region, they're better able to spread their ideas, as well as their products, better able to ship and market those products when they have a better understanding of how to communicate with those along the supply chain, and what this means is that we get more economic proficiency and productivity not just in developed but also in developing nations when they're able to spread their products more easily across the globe, it equalizes the playing field so that you don't simply need a good education in order to learn multiple languages to function, but when everyone is speaking the same language, it means that all people start out with this basic ability to communicate with one another and to be treated with the respect and dignity that people deserve because there are no communication barriers that are left between individuals, because that better connects the world that is increasingly globalized anyway and allows for imperialist forces to be repealed, I think that global language is certainly advantageous.
