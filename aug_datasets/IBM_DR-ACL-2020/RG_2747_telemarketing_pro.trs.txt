This house would ban telemarketing.
What we mean by this is that campaigns that use the telephone and cold calling people to sell their products would no longer be allowed.
You could obviously still have areas in which an individual has to call a certain number to make a purchase but you would not be able to specifically market using the telephone like product as we currently have in the status quo.
Three main areas of clash, first on why this is just generally a really problematic way of attempting to sell things.
I think what we have to recognize is that telemarketing relies on this idea that there are individuals who are going to be either tired enough or uninformed enough or don't have enough time to do their research to make a purchase at the moment that someone is calling their door.
We think that it's actually really really coercive in that it basically tells people like look we're catching you in this situation in which maybe you're less comfortable maybe you're in the middle of a like a private matter or in the middle of your everyday life and we're going to use the opportunity to try and sell you something and we think that like even if this isn't something that is intrinsically bad insofar as there are many many or like legally bad insofar as there are many many ways for individuals to sell products in other ways especially with the invention of things like the internet we don't understand why it is necessary to have something like telemarketing which tries to playoff of individuals' weaknesses.
We especially think that it gets worse when we recognize it compounds with preexisting things such as targeted advertisement we think that given that individuals are going to be bombarded with imagery of things they probably don't need but might have mentioned that they want either way we think it's problematic that they can also be targeted over the phone.
Our second area of clash is just that it's annoying.
We think that insofar as governments exist to protect the average citizen and we think that these protections can come in many forms not just in terms of security we don't think that there's anything that telemarketing accomplishes that other forms of sale cannot so we don't understand why it's like an unfair limitation on the market rather we think it's the government just being like look even if this isn't like personal to the safety of our citizens it's still something that brings them a significant amount of distrust and irritation so we might as well keep them from having to experience this and we think the problem is that even telemarketers don't like telemarketing when it happens to themselves.
So and and given that this isn't something that we think is at a significant drop off in jobs insofar as these kinds of jobs just transferred to the other form of marketing that occurs we don't think there's actually any kind of real harm to stopping this as a practice and so the fact that it is like incredibly irritating to individuals and not something that anyone wants to deal with becomes incredibly important and outweighs the majority of anything else in this round because there aren't any harmful impacts on op's upside.
So it makes it something that is essentially just like look like if there's a situation that sucks and you're able to change that situation without actually harming anyone else you probably ought change that situation.
Finally though, we want to talk about the insecurity of telemarketing because we think that in a world where individuals are recording our voices and using them to access our bank accounts and other voice activated media in a world in which they are listening in conversations to listen to things like our car so like our cards we have to recognize that telemarketing corporations usually don't have the money to do things like secure the lines that they are using like make sure that nobody is recording the speech that is being said and so we think that something that happens that is really problematic on their side of the house is that telemarketing campaigns are always more easily hacked than the alternatives which poses a massive security threat to the individuals who might buy something via telemarketing.
Insofar as that is true we think that we ought differ to the things that are more secure so that we don't take these kinds of risks in the first place.
Proud to propose.
