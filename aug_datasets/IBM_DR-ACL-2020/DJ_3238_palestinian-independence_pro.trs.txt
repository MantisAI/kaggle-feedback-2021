We should fight for palestinian independence.
So to start, I think it's important to point out that playing the blame game of whether or not there's deserve palestinians deserve their own state, whether or not palestinians or israelis are at fault for the conflict in general, it is I think rather pointless discussion at this point because at this point it's been a fifty year long conflict really really even longer than that where thousands just are left dead and will continue to die and it's a cycle to the point where nobody is really individually responsible because for every bad act that palestinians commit for every terrorist attack that like maybe like a stabbing on a bus or a bombing or firing a rocket somewhere, you see israel retaliating by firing a targeted drone strike and it saying oh well the civilians that die is just collateral damage and it gets to the point where it becomes a cycle where there's nothing but hatred and everyone and there's no real conflict resolution that's possible.
So I think the only real solution is to just accept that palestinians need independence and that's the only way to just stop people from dying which really should be the primary goal that people are thinking about.
So it's important to start by thinking about this in that palestinians should have their own state and any arguments to the contrary are either rooted in racism where the fact that it's going to be bad for israel is israel's security.
The argument the palestinians don't deserve a state is just obviously problematic.
The fact that if you're if you believe that israel has like a divine right of some kind of religious right to all of the land of like ancient biblical israel, then you're no better than honestly someone from ISIS who wants to establish a fucking caliphate because they think that that's their religious birthright.
The fact that you can try to draw up like in like a modern society political boundaries on the basis of like like like millennia old like fairy tales in a lot of ways is absolutely preposterous.
So we should dispense with any kind of fiction that israel should have some kind of divine right or inherent right to any kind of land, certainly not anymore so.
We should just like establish this on the basis of really what is going to stop bloodshed, what is going to make sense given the people who actually live in communities now and given that whether israel likes it or not whether israel would prefer that like palestinians didn't exist in like hebron or jericho or places like that, the fact of the matter is is that there's millions and millions of palestinians that live there and they're not going to go anywhere and they deserve the right to have their own policies and manage their affairs in a way in which they see fit without interference from israel.
As far as the argument that israel's security isn't going to be maintained, I think it's worth putting this as like in the comparative perspective because the occupation that is ongoing right now is certainly not making israel's security any better because every time israel fires a drone strike or targeted rocket to kill a hamas militant and civilians end up dying, then the child who lost their father or the like family members who are dying or friends and neighbors who are dying they don't look at this is simply well that person was a terrorist and therefore it's justified for israel to kill my family members.
It ultimately it like sows down hatred that is impossible to overcome in a lot of ways which is why you constantly see cycles of violence, it's why you see such like a fervent radicalization among certain people so I think that a a palestinian independence would do a whole lot for making the average palestinian actually think that israel values their lives and values their freedom in a lot more fundamental ways than I think it does right now.
So for all those reasons we should fight for palestinian independence.
