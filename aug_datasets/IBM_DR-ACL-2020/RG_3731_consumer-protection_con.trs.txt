We should increase we shouldn't increase consumer protection.
First, I think it's important to remember that consumers are already massively protected in the status quo and we think that any kind of further protections are completely unnecessary.
Like at the point that I have the right to information about these companies, at the point that we're heavily regulating the like honesty of these company's campaigns and at the point that we can do things like sue these companies if they're not fulfilling those promises, I'm not really sure what exactly these kinds of protections would look like except for maybe requiring more information to be released things like GMO information and other more specific product information and realistically these things don't serve any purpose and basically it's just yelling into the void or kind of building on paranoia that already exists in society about issues that it shouldn't exist about.
So like building on the fact that you have specific people who are really against genetic modification but don't really have a reason to be, now just get more kind of fuel to that unnecessary fire and I think the problem with this is that you're kind of compounding the lack of necessity with fairly high burdens on businesses to perform these kinds of protections and I think we have to recognize what those trade-offs look like because I'm sure that government came up here and just talked about how we care about consumers and human rights and things like that but if those rights are already being protected and there's already like a lot of support given to these people then I don't understand why we would ever do more if we don't need to especially given the cost.
Two main arguments: first, on increasing costs.
With increasing consumer protections comes increasing costs because companies will have to adapt and extend departments as per these protections.
So if you have new consumer protections that change the way liability works, you have to do things like extend more money for your legal teams to preempt that or you have to put money into teams that will cover all of your bases and do all of the research that is now needed and you have to kind of like beef up all of your your teams as well because more people are going to be using these protections, right?
You're going to have more lawsuits necessarily because it covers more that companies previously didn't have to take care of and I think at the point this is true, we have to talk about where this cost gets displaced to and I think there's two main avenues in which that happens: first, in the costs of goods and services provided.
When companies have to shell out more for protections it means they have a lot less money to put into their goods and services and they're making less of a net profit on those goods and services so the price has to increase in order to compensate and we think this is actually really really bad because you just get less people who can afford things that are often central to their existence.
So things like medications or technology or other such things that we really come to expect as like part of our standard of living in a modern society and I think the second layer in which this happens is when those companies have to cut jobs in other sectors because they need to make that money back somewhere so they just end up firing people to try and to make up for the costs and that's bad because we think unemployment is something we should be avoiding.
But the second argument is that it disadvantages small companies.
First recognize that these companies don't have the money or infrastructure to put these consumer protections in place in the first place and it opens them up to huge lawsuits which creates an awful double bind where they can't afford to put protections in place but simultaneously can't afford the potential lawsuits and this greatly increases the startup costs to becoming a new small business in the first place which is awful for the economy and really bad for the people who are trying to get on their feet from this and large companies are going to have the resources so they'll be fine either way.
This is just the government making it easier for them to monopolize everything by doing the work of forcing small companies out on behalf of these larger companies which we think is really really problematic.
Proud to oppose.
