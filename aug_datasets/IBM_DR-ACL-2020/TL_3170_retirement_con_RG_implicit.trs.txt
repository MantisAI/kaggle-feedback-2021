We should not end mandatory retirement.
So, the big argument, that we want to put forward in this debate, is that we don't think that people should be forced to work through their whole life.
So, we're going to go through and explain, why this is the case, and why mandatory retirement is likely to lead into a world, in which people are going to have to work much longer than they deserve to work.
Okay, so in the status quo, people do not choose to interact with a capitalist market, they don't choose to enter the job market, at least not freely.
They don't have a free choice, because in the status quo, if you choose not to work, you get left behind in a wide variety of ways that impact your health, your wealth, your well being, your ability to interact in the social sphere, your entire life is dictated by the fact that you must be in the labor force, which means that people are often forced to make trade offs, to allow them to be in that labor force, even when they otherwise were they given some sort of basic income, that was a stipend for their living, would have chosen to do a variety of other things.
People in the status quo, are simply en mass not really fulfilled by their job, people work for the weekend, they don't work so that they can be at their job, doing innovation, and doing things that are fulfilling to them in the office, though some people obviously have those experiences, and it doesn' this doesn't detract from those people, but what it does mean is that a wide variety of people end up spending a third of their life half of their waking hours, laboring in a place, where they don't want to be, where they're not having their time fulfilled.
And this is problematic, because if people are constantly working to earn a wage, to accumulate wealth, to do what have you, to try and ensure that they can be alive, there's no purpose to that time that they're alive, there's no purpose to that wealth accumulation, if people aren't then able to go on and use that time, use what they've learned, use their experiences, to do things that meaningfully fulfill them.
The things that, when you reflect upon a life, those the things that you want to remember, the things that meaningfully fulfilled you.
We think that mandatory retirement ensures that workers, firstly, plan for the future, because they know that they aren't going to be able to work in perpetuity, which means it forces them to be long term planners.
Secondly, it it gives a number of benefits to businesses to help their employees plan for the future, by doing things like developing, a four o one kay, and some sort of investment portfolio, these things that allow people to retire, and other aside from all that, we think that older workers are simply not as a efficient.
Older workers don't have the skill for drastically changing labor market, they don't have the specialties and expertise of younger people, and when they are in these positions, they're usually less efficient, and they take jobs away from younger individuals, who are trying to break into the labor market, that otherwise cannot do so.
We think it's a massive inefficiency, and we'd rather have people be forced to retire, and the the real issue with this is that, if you end mandatory retirement, what you're likely to see is a slide towards removing things like social security, and elderly care, because there's political will to do those things in the status quo, people feel that these things are massive government expenditures that shouldn't exist, and if people are able to work until they're eighty, ninety years old, it means that they are technically capable of subsidizing themselves, of supporting themselves.
We think that this is bad, because we think that what is likely going to happen is that you force people to work in low income situations, you force people to work in low income jobs and opportunities, just to just for subsistence for themselves, when in a time period, when they otherwise could be doing the things that are meaningfully fulfilling to them, and meaningfully important to them, we don't think that life is about labor, we don't think that life is about work, and for these reasons, we should not end the mandatory retirement.
