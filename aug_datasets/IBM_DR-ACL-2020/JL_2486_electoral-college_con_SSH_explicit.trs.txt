We should not abolish the electoral college ï¿½ country to what sam tells you, we're going to explain why the direct vote is actually not desirable for a democracy and secondly why on our side of the house we get more political will for less privileged areas.
So first I want to talk about direct voting because sam essentially tells you that it's undemocratic not to let people have direct representation but rather to have an electoral college that kind of mitigates the directness of that by giving more representation to certain groups and ensuring that there are trustees who maintain the electoral college rather than just voting the way people want them to.
On our side we argue that the existing US system undermines tyranny of the majority.
Right now there are guarantees that minority groups can still have their voice heard and can still participate in this process.
And moreover it ensures that if some antidemocratic populist factions say were to vote in an election that the electoral college would be a check against that influence.
In other words we think that the electoral college moderates the worst instincts of the majority and that it ensures that a small majority can't impose their will on everyone else with dramatic harms.
We think that representation isn't the only concern of a democracy and this goes directly against everything you heard from sam.
We think that stability is also important and it's clear that the electoral college has helped the US to maintain stability.
I think that one reason why the US has tended to have fairly moderate governments compared to most other democracies around the world, that is to say there haven't been very many far left or far right governments in the united states, is partly because we have the system of trustees in place.
You wouldn't just have to convince the people, who may be naive or politically illiterate, you also have to convince the electors and we think that they absolutely can be a check against someone who is unsuited to the office or a threat to the republic being put into a position of power.
So we think that as a result that the electoral college is actually a boon for democracy and could help to maintain democracy in its darkest hour if some sort of populist dictator or populist figure tried to come to power.
But our second argument is about how this insures more political will for less privileged areas.
There are certain parts of the united states that will always dominate the national scene like new york and california just because they have lots and lots of people and they have major cities where elites live.
But as a result even fairly populous areas outside of the coasts, many areas of the interior, don't get a lot of attention politically speaking except for the fact that they have disproportionate representation in some areas of government.
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that no senator or representative who doesn't live in wyoming cares if people there live or die.
Like most politicians are self serving, they don't care about helping other people, only about getting their own goals achieved.
As a result they would probably ignore people in very poor areas of the US like west virginia if it weren't for the fact that those groups are over represented in the electoral college.
This forces elites and forces people in wealthier areas to take notice of what's happening in less well off areas and in more rural areas.
It prevents a few large cities from ruling over the rest of the country and ignoring their needs.
So we think that this is basically a transfer of political power partially from very wealthy privileged areas to much poorer, less privileged areas and therefore that in a sense this actually protects the american people.
It ensures that their interests are taken account of even if in a certain sense it takes away the ability of some people to be proportionally represented.
And since the system is still somewhat proportional we think that this is a fair trade-off.
For all these reasons we should not abolish the electoral college.
Thank you.
