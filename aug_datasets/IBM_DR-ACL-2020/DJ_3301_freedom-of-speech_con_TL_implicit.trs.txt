We should not limit freedom of speech because freedom of speech is the way in which we can express ourselves in a democratic society to try to foster change and persuade other people and there's nothing more important in a democratic society than that.
So let's start by talking about why freedom of speech is just such a fundamental and important thing, and this goes down to first a basic right that you have.
Independent of everything else in a democratic society you should be able to express yourself and what you believe because if you can't express yourselves through your voice and through your literal words, then there's really no hope for a democratic society to actually be democratic because the ability to express ourselves is the ultimate way in which we can actually have a truly democratic society.
And this goes into the second thing which is that it can be like a call to action or a call to organize when you actually use your voice as a basis for this.
And as a as a third point under that it can also make sure that we have more of a diversity of voices in society because when you keep hearing the same voices over and over again because if you limit freedom of speech maybe only certain voices are getting heard then that can make it more likely that ideas in society are going to get stagnant, that people are going to keep hearing the same things over and over again, that you're not actually going to get an an evolution of ideals in society and of thought in society and that's one of that's like really the core at why freedom of speech is incredibly necessary.
But moreover it's also important to look at what limiting freedom of speech would look like in practice and why that would be problematic because it's important to note that freedom of speech would be limited in a necessarily non-neutral way cause how are you limiting speech?
You're probably limiting it through some kind of laws, through political through literal through laws, through the state.
So the state is going to probably do so in such a way in which it's going to limit certain things so like maybe you can't criticize the government in x y z way, maybe you can't talk about certain things because it's seen as like profane or lewd or whatever, maybe you can't talk about this or that but there's all this is going to be done in such a way in which to kind of protect majoritarian narratives so like a good example in america is like there is a supreme court case it that took place in alaska actually it's known as like colloquially the bong hits for jesus case where somebody as like a protest of like marijuana laws basically and how their like messed up at an olympic torch relay in juneau, alaska held up a sign that said bong hits for jesus and people criticized that is like oh well this is obviously the kind of speech that you can limit it's a joke, it's satire, it doesn't really have any value to society but I think that's like a fundamentally problematic way of looking at it because that's through the lens of like the majority view which is going to be enacting laws in the first place but it doesn't take into account what other people considering it, what other perspectives people may have, which is maybe that people look at this as like an incredibly messed up thing and as a way to like bring more attention to a situation that isn't that you need to make more of a point of.
So given all of that, I think that it's important to make sure that we recognize that speech is an inherent right and it's something that's really important to everybody to have and that moreover the government bodies that would be regulating speech probably can't be trusted to do it in a very good way.
So for all those reasons, we should not limit speech.
