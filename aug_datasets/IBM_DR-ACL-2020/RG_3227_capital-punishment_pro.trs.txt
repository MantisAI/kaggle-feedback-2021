The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish capital punishment.
We think this is not like mutually exclusive with intensifying other kinds of punishments like we that we're fine with doing things like replacing capital punishment or like replacing the punishment for crimes for which capital punishment would have been used with harsher sentences and things like that what we're not fine is that we just like don't think it's okay to kill another individual in response to a crime.
Three main areas of two main areas of clash, first on why it is immoral for a few reasons.
First we think that it is incredibly cruel.
We think that insofar as like human beings are choosing whether or not to punish other people like there is no overall authority that is able to define whether or not someone deserves that which is coming down on them we use certain kinds of standards to make sure that our internal biases and like our other kinds of natures or our vengelfulness doesn't come against just like basic human rights and respecting individual life and we think that one of the standards that we use is the standard of cruel and unusual punishment which we see legally recognized in multiple states but we also just think is a good principle to follow insofar as we buy that individuals probably are intrinsically equal and even if you do something that is very very bad you probably don't deserve to be treated with intense cruelty insofar as punishment can be given to you in other kinds of ways and we think that insofar as death is the ultimate end to anything that you can accomplish in the future we think it is the ultimate form of cruelty that it deprives the individual of everything that any other person will be able to experience in the rest of their life.
Insofar as it doesn't meet that basic standard we don't think that it is something that ought be performed but also under think under this we knew that it is an incredibly racist policy and an arbitrary one in that we know that people have certain biases that tell them that certain races of individuals are more dangerous or more likely to have committed crimes than other ones so we see this with how we see that the capital punishment is instituted infinitely more often for black men than for white men even when they commit the same exact crimes and insofar as this racist enforcement occurs we don't think that's a moral action or something that is morally justifiable.
But also we think that the arbitrariness of it is also dangerous in that insofar as whether or not I end up with the death penalty or just a couple of life sentences in prison can be defined by whether or not the judge had lunch before.
We don't understand how something so arbitrary and so non generalizable can ever be moral.
But finally we think the real center here is just that it has the massive potential for harming the innocent.
Insofar as the guilty can get punished even without capital punishment but on the other hand innocent get the ultimate rights violation we think that it is never justified to commit capital punishment on the off chance risk that you are going to kill someone who is who is actually innocent because of all the damage that they will suffer so and we think that ultimately is what really makes it immoral and can never ever be justified because we think that these kinds of purposes of punishment happen to make sure that someone doesn't commit a crime again or to make sure they're no longer dangerous for society things like that but we don't think any of that comes into play when you are hurting those that you are supposed to be protecting in the first place.
But our second area of clash is just about why it's unpragmatic.
First recognize that the death penalty is actually more expensive than just housing someone in a jail first because you never have the opportunity for parole so whereas costs can be cut down significantly when individuals are let off on good behavior and things like that with jail time this never happens with the death penalty but also because it has so many bureaucratic holes that you have to jump through in terms of liability and in terms of the drugs that you have to pay for and things like that and all the people you have to pay along the way it's actually statistically a lot more expensive to kill someone as punishment than it is to keep that person in jail and insofar as we think that any money that comes out of like the taxpayer's pocket is probably a loss to the taxpayer when it's not used to benefit them and this is just a punishment for someone else we think that that's something that is incredibly unpragmatic and ought not happen.
Proud to propose.
